```

## Usage

To run this repo, you need to set up some environment variables. You can use the `.env` file provided in the repo as a template. Copy the file and rename it as `.env` and fill in the values for the following variables:

- `FLASK_APP`: The name of the Flask app to run. It should be `app.py`.
- `FLASK_ENV`: The environment for Flask to run in. It can be either `development` or `production`.
- `AUTH_TOKEN_EXPIRATION`: The number of seconds for the authentication token to expire.
- `AUTH_SESSION_EXPIRATION`: The number of seconds for the authentication session to expire.
- `AUTH_SESSION_COOKIE_NAME`: The name of the cookie to store the authentication session ID.
- `AUTH_SESSION_COOKIE_DOMAIN`: The domain of the cookie to store the authentication session ID.
- `AUTH_SESSION_COOKIE_PATH`: The path of the cookie to store the authentication session ID.
- `AUTH_SESSION_COOKIE_SECURE`: A boolean value indicating whether the cookie should be secure or not.
- `AUTH_SESSION_COOKIE_HTTPONLY`: A boolean value indicating whether the cookie should be HTTP-only or not.
- `AUTH_SESSION_COOKIE_SAMESITE`: The value for the SameSite attribute of the cookie. It can be either `Lax`, `Strict`, or `None`.
- `DATABASE_URL`: The URL for the database connection. It should follow the format: `dialect+driver://username:password@host:port/database`.

After setting up the environment variables, you can run the Flask app using:

```bash
flask run
```

This will start a development server on http://127.0.0.1:5000/. You can use a tool like Postman or curl to test the endpoints provided by the app.

## Modules

This repo contains several modules that demonstrate different aspects of backend user data handling. Each module has its own directory with a README file that explains its objectives, tasks, and requirements. The modules are:

- 0x00-personal_data: This module covers how to protect personal data from unauthorized access and how to log user activities using Python.
- 0x01-Basic_authentication: This module covers how to implement basic authentication using Flask and bcrypt.
- 0x02-Session_authentication: This module covers how to implement session authentication using Flask and cookies.
- 0x03-user_authentication_service: This module covers how to implement a user authentication service using Flask, SQLAlchemy, and PyJWT.
